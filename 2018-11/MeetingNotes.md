## Presentation Overview
Simple rules and when to break them. The complement to crowd wisdom is crowd folly. The PowerShell technical community has collectively spent hundreds of thousands of hours doing things wrong and learning the hard way, leading to PowerShell Best Practices. We have also spent considerable time demonstrating that slavish adherence to these rules is equal folly.
Join us to hear Tim Curwick talk about a pragmatic approach to PowerShell automation which emphasizes optimizing every script differently to improve the lives of you, your coworkers, and your users, and to add value to your company. Let's make the world a better place with PowerShell! Failing that, let's make your job suck less with PowerShell.
Tim is an automation consultant at RBA, Microsoft PowerShell MVP, blogger at MadWithPowerShell.com, speaker, and co-author of the PowerShell Conference Book.
