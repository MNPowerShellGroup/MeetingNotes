# Understanding the .Net objects in your PowerShell scripts

## Presentation Overview

PowerShell is .Net based. Everything in PowerShell is a .Net object. Everything Microsoft is a .Net object that you have access to. A better understanding of .Net objects opens a whole new world of what can be done with PowerShell for scripters at any level.

Join us to hear Tim Curwick share what .Net objects are, how they work, how to use them, and even how to define your own custom objects. Tim is an IT automation consultant and PowerShell trainer with RBA, a blogger, speaker, and contributing author of The PowerShell Conference Book. <https://leanpub.com/powershell-conference-book>
