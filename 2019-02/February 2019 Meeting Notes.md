## GitHub with VSCode Presentation Overview

In this session, we'll be discussing how to setup and use GitHub within VSCode. This will be an interactive session that you can follow along with as I go through some of the demos and installations.

We'll start by looking at VSCode, then installing Git on the computer and then adding a GitHub repository. We'll then synchronize changes between the local computer and GitHub and we'll show some of the VSCode extensions that make working with GitHub very easy within your VSCode. We'll look at what happens when merging data has conflicts and how to resolve those conflicts.

Whether you are the lone scripter in your company, or part of an international scripting team, we'll show how the benefits of GitHub can make your scripting life easier.

We'll discuss
- Why source code is important
- Real world experience of using source control within VSCode
- When to branch
- Sharing your code with the world versus private repositories
